This resource was helpful in learning how to install language tools needed for python -
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial

I installed python3 using homebrew, and added the python extension to VSCode.

And these resources were helpful for learning the basics of how the language works -
https://www.learnpython.org/
https://realpython.com/

These resources taught me the basics of how to interact with the console, how python handles variable declarations (or rather, doesn't handle declarations), format strings and argument specifiers, lists, for and while loops, and functions.  Specific examples and more detailed descriptions can be found in the hello.py file.
